Students Performance Exploratory Data Analysis

In this session, I will use various methods of exploratory data analysis to examine the characteristics of the "Students Performance in Exams" dataset.
The data contains eight variables used to explore the effect of various factors on test scores. The variables are:
Gender - male or female 
Race/Ethnicity - split into 5 Groups (A, B, C, D, E) 
Parent Education Level - a student's parent's highest level of education 
Lunch - whether a student is in the standard or free/reduced lunch program 
Test Prep Course - whether or not a student completed the test preparation course 
Math Score 
Reading Score 
Writing Score 
Note: this is a fictional dataset used strictly for to demonstrate beginner data analysis skills. 
The results are not official and should not be used to conclude actual relationships between the variables listed and education.
